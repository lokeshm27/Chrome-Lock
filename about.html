			<h1> About Chrome Lock </h1>

					<li><h2> Security </h2>
						<p>
							We worked hard on this extension to make this extension as secure as possible. This extension is more secure than other extensions, To give one example, Unlike other extensions the password is not stored raw. Since, Chrome will not encrypt the extension data and it's not difficult to access an extension's data. We implemented best methods 
							to make this extenion secure, The advanced protection, but that may use more system resources, so We added an option to enable the Advanced protection.
							With Advanced protection by passing the extensions security won't be a piece of cake.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li><h2> Design </h2>
						<p>
							We have designed both looks (front-end) and functionality (back-end) of the extension as good as possible. We made sure that the design of the extension won't trouble you. 
							We have emphasized on small details without which it will hard to work around the extension. This extension consits of many web-pages. We have designed the web pages as good as possible without taking much time.

					<li><h2> Options and Features </h2>
						<p>
							Chrome Lock extension come with many options. We have given you the choice to select how extension should behave in some conditions without effecting the functionality of the extension.
							We have used the best method availbale to implement a feature, But Some features are still in beta-stage. Beta-Stage features works but it means that we have not yet tested its working in
